[2026-02-22 04:50] User requested routing to an 'Engineer' agent using Gemini Pro 2.5. Current workspace tools only support Qwen3 models (as shown in TOOLS.md). Gemini Pro 2.5 is not self-hostable and requires Google Cloud API access. Assistant needs to check if 'eng' agent is installed via ClawHub and if Gemini API access is configured.

[2026-02-22 05:01] User asked how to run the newly created gemini_query.py script. Assistant confirmed the script was saved at /Users/bhavipatel/Documents/bobbybot/scripts/gemini_query.py and outlined steps to install dependencies, verify config.json, and execute the script. User's workspace path and script location were explicitly noted.
