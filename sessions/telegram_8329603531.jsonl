{"role": "assistant", "content": "To use **Gemini Pro 2.5** (or any Google Gemini model) for heavy computational tasks, you\u2019d need to work within Google\u2019s ecosystem, as Gemini models are **not open-source** and cannot be self-hosted like Qwen, LLaMA, or Mistral. Here\u2019s how you could approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Use Google\u2019s API (if available)**\nIf Gemini Pro 2.5 is publicly accessible via Google\u2019s AI Platform:\n- **API Access**: Use the `@google/generative-ai` Python library to interface with Gemini.\n- **Example Code**:\n  ```python\n  import google.generativeai as genai\n\n  genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n  model = genai.GenerativeModel(\"gemini-pro-2.5\")\n  response = model.generate_content(\"Your heavy power question here\")\n  print(response.text)\n  ```\n- **Requirements**:\n  - A Google Cloud account with API credits.\n  - Proper permissions to access Gemini models (may require approval).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Self-Hosting Limitations**\nGemini models are **proprietary** and not available for download. Self-hosting would require:\n- Access to the model weights (not publicly provided by Google).\n- Significant computational resources (e.g., GPUs/TPUs).\n\nIf you\u2019re self-hosting, consider alternatives like **Qwen3**, **LLaMA 3**, or **Mistral** for high-capacity tasks. For example:\n```bash\n# Example: Running Qwen3 locally (requires model files)\nuvx mlx_lm server --model Qwen3-32B-4bit --port 8080\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Cloud-Based Solutions**\nIf you cannot self-host Gemini:\n- Use **Google Cloud AI Platform** (if access is granted).\n- Explore competitors like **Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3**, **Meta\u2019s Llama 3**, or **Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3** for similar power.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Check for Updates**\nAs of my knowledge cutoff (July 2024), **Gemini Pro 2.5 is not publicly available**.

You\u2019d need to:\n     - Use `clawhub` to install a Gemini agent (if it exists).\n     - Or manually write/execute a script (as we did).\n\n---\n\n### **What Nanobot *Can* Do**\n- Run your `gemini_query.py` script via `exec` (as shown earlier).\n- Handle the API key and script configuration for you.\n- Alert you to errors (e.g., missing API key, SDK, or permissions).\n\n---\n\n### **If You Can\u2019t Use Google\u2019s API**\nIf you\u2019re self-hosting or want to avoid Google\u2019s ecosystem, consider these Nanobot-compatible alternatives:\n- **Qwen3** (already in your `TOOLS.md`).\n- **Llama 3** or **Mistral** (open-source, self-hostable).\n- Use `clawhub` to find and install agents for these models.\n\nWould you like help setting up one of these instead? \ud83d\ude80", "timestamp": "2026-02-22T05:05:30.383314", "tools_used": null}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Nanobot **cannot natively use the Gemini CLI** (or any proprietary CLI tools) because:\n\n1. **No Official Gemini CLI Exists**  \n   Google does not provide a standalone CLI tool for Gemini models. Interaction with Gemini requires:\n   - The **Google Generative AI SDK** (Python library).\n   - A **Google Cloud API key** with access to Gemini models.\n\n2. **Nanobot\u2019s Limitations**  \n   Nanobot is a lightweight framework that can execute scripts, call APIs, or use models **if you configure them**. It cannot \"learn\" or interface with proprietary tools like Gemini CLI unless explicitly programmed via scripts or agents.\n\n---\n\n### **How You Can Enable Gemini CLI-Style Behavior**\nIf you want to \"teach\" Nanobot to use Gemini via the Google SDK (as a CLI-style tool), follow these steps:\n\n#### **Step 1: Install the Google SDK**\n```bash\npip install google-generativeai\n```\n\n#### **Step 2: Write a Script for Gemini (e.g., `gemini.sh` or `gemini.py`)**\nExample Python script (`gemini_query.py`):\n```python\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nimport json\nimport sys\n\n# Load config\nwith open(\"config.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    config = json.load(f)\n\n# Validate API key\nif not config.get(\"google_api_key\"):\n    print(\"\u274c Error: Missing 'google_api_key' in config.json\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Configure the SDK\ngenai.configure(api_key=config[\"google_api_key\"])\n\n# Get query from command line\nif len(sys.argv) < 2:\n    print(\"\u274c Usage: python gemini_query.py \\\"Your question here\\\"\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nquery = \" \".join(sys.argv[1:])\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(\"gemini-pro-2.\u9517\")\nresponse = model.generate_content(query)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n#### **Step 3: Use `exec` to Run the Script via Nanobot**\nWhen you ask a question (e.g., *\"Explain quantum computing\"*), I\u2019ll execute:\n```bash\npython /path/to/gemini_query.py \"Explain quantum computing\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works**\n- **`exec` Tool**: Nanobot can run scripts dynamically via the `exec` tool.\n- **Config File**: You\u2019ll need a `config.json` with your Google API key:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"google_api_key\": \"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **If You Can\u2019t Use Google\u2019s API**\nIf you\u2019re self-hosting or want to avoid Google\u2019s ecosystem, consider these Nanobot-compatible alternatives:\n- **Qwen3** (already in your `TOOLS.md`).\n- **Llama 3** or **Mistral** (open-source, self-hostable).\n- Use `clawhub` to find and install agents for these models.\n\nWould you like help setting up one of these instead? \ud83d\ude80", "timestamp": "2026-02-22T05:15:31.639435", "tools_used": null}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "The link you provided appears to be a **hypothetical or fictional repository** (as of July 2024, no official `gemini-cli` exists for Google\u2019s Gemini models). However, assuming this is a **community-created CLI tool** for interacting with Gemini, here\u2019s how you could integrate it with Nanobot:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Install the CLI (if it exists)**\nIf `gemini-cli` is a package (e.g., via npm, pip, or binary), install it:\n```bash\n# Example (hypothetical)\nnpm install -g gemini-cli\n# or\npip install gemini-cli\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Configure API Key**\nMost CLI tools require an API key. You\u2019d need to:\n- Store your Google API key in a config file (e.g., `~/.gemini/config` or `config.json`).\n- Set environment variables (e.g., `export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Use `exec` to Run the CLI via Nanobot**\nWhen you ask a question (e.g., *\"Explain quantum computing\"*), Nanobot would execute:\n```bash\ngemini-cli --model gemini-pro-2.5 \"Explain quantum computing\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Scripting for Automation**\nCreate a shell script (`gemini.sh`) to handle the CLI:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ngemini-cli --model gemini-pro-2.5 \"$@\"\n```\n\nThen, Nanobot can call it via:\n```bash\nexec /path/to/gemini.sh \"Your question here\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Important Notes**\n- **No Official CLI**: Google does not provide an official CLI for Gemini. Use at your own risk.\n- **Security Risks**: Third-party CLI tools may expose your API key or have vulnerabilities.\n- **Alternatives**: If you cannot use Google\u2019s API, consider open-source models like **Qwen3** or **Llama 3** (already in your `TOOLS.md`).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help set up a script for a hypothetical `gemini-cli` or explore open-source alternatives instead? \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f", "timestamp": "2026-02-22T05:24:44.340161", "tools_used": null}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "To enable **Brave Search** integration for up-to-date information retrieval, here's how you can configure it:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Use the `web_search` Tool (Already Available)**\nNanobot's `web_search` tool can already fetch current information from the web. While it might default to Google or another search engine, **Brave Search is not explicitly configured** in the current toolset. However, you can use `web_search` as is for up-to-date results:\n\n```python\nweb_search(query=\"latest information on AI in 2026\", count=5)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. If Brave Search Is Required**\nIf you **specifically need Brave Search results**, you would need to:\n1. **Check if Brave provides an API** (as of 2026, Brave may have an official API for developers).\n2. **Update the `web_search` tool** to use Brave's API (requires backend changes not accessible via Nanobot's current tools).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Workaround: Use `web_fetch` for Brave Search**\nIf Brave Search has a public API, you could write a script to interface with it. For example:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef brave_search(query):\n    url = f\"https://api.brave.com/search?query={query}\"\n    headers = {\"X-Brave-Auth\": \"YOUR_BRAVE_API_KEY\"}\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    return response.json()\n```\n\nThen call it via `exec`:\n```bash\npython /path/to/brave_script.py \"latest information on AI in 2026\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Current Limitations**\n- **No direct Brave integration** in Nanobot's default tools.\n- **`web_search`** might use Google or another engine, but it still fetches up-to-date results as of 2026.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Best Practice**\nFor now, use the existing `web_search` tool for current information. If Brave Search is critical, you\u2019d need to:\n1. Verify Brave\u2019s API availability.\n2. Write a custom script to use it.\n3.

None of these directly generate a Mermaid diagram. Mermaid is a markup language for generating diagrams, so maybe the user expects me to create a Mermaid code snippet that they can render themselves.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to \"generate\" the diagram. Since I can't execute Mermaid code here, perhaps I should generate the Mermaid syntax and let them use it in their environment. Alternatively, maybe they want me to create a file with the Mermaid code. Let me think.\n\nThe user might not have specified the type of diagram, like flowchart, sequence, etc. I should ask for more details. But wait, the initial query is just \"generate_mermaid_diagram\". Maybe they want a basic example. However, without specifics, it's hard to know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want me to use a tool to generate it. But looking at the functions again, there's no image generation tool. The exec function could run a command if there's a tool installed, but that's risky and depends on the environment.
